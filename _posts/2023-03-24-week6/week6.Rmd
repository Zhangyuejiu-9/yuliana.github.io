During this week, I took my first exam of principle of Biology. Since I am a art student in my senior high school, I almost lerned nothing about biology before this course. It is too hard for me to self-learn for this couse.

However, I would never gave up. I choose to first print out all the lecture materials, and then read them and mark the key points row by row. After I finished all the readings, I summarized the key points of each chapters and wrote them dowm on one piece of A4-sheet paper.

After I finished all the summaries, I reread the lecture slides again, and this time, I thought I well-prepared for that exam. 

Finally, I still cannot answer all the questions, but I think my work paid off and got a above averaged grade.
