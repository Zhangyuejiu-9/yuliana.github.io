It is too hard for me to self-learn for this couse.\nHowever, I would never gave up. I choose to first print out all the lecture materials, and then read them and mark the key points row by row. After I finished all the readings, I summarized the key points of each chapters and wrote them dowm on one piece of A4-sheet paper.\nAfter I finished all the summaries, I reread the lecture slides again, and this time, I thought I well-prepared for that exam.\nFinally, I still cannot answer all the questions, but I think my work paid off and got a above averaged grade.\n\n\n\n",
